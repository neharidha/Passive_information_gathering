# Passive_information_gathering

During this step, we aim to collect as much data about the target as possible, including the target organization’s infrastructure, assets, and personnel. This helps us build our knowledge of the target’s attack surface.

2 Types

1)Passive Information Gathering

2)Active Information Gathering

1)Passive Information Gathering


Passive Information Gathering, also known as Open-source Intelligence (OSINT), is the process of collecting openly-available information about a target, generally without any direct interaction with that target. The ultimate goal of passive information gathering is to obtain information that clarifies or expands an attack surface.

Eg: if the target’s website allows us to register for an account, we could do that. However, we would not test the website for vulnerabilities during this phase.

we could rely on third parties for information, but we couldn’t access any of the target’s systems or servers

1)Whois Enumeration

Whois is a TCP service, tool, and type of database that can provide information about a domain name, such as the name server and registrar.

2)Google Hacking

So, Google Hacking is like a fancy search string and operator that helps you get more specific results when you’re looking for something.

Operator eg: site, filetype, intitle

3)Netcraft

This is a free web portal that performs various information-gathering functions, such as discovering which technologies are running on a given website and finding which other hosts share the same IP netblock.

4)Open-Source Code

So, you’ve got these open-source projects and online code repositories like GitHub, GitHub Gist, GitLab, and SourceForge.

Basically, when code is stored online, you can take a peek at what programming languages and frameworks an organization is using. And get this, sometimes developers accidentally spill the beans on sensitive data and credentials by committing them to public repos. Yikes!

5)Shodan

So, basically, what Shodan does is look for devices that are hooked up to the internet, talk to them, and then show you all the juicy details about them.

6)Security Headers and SSL/TLS

Security Headers will analyze the HTTP response headers of the target site and provide a basic analysis of its security posture.
